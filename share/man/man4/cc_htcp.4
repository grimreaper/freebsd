.Sh NAME
.Nm cc_htcp
.Nd HTCP Congestion Control Algorithm
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.N
congestion control algorithm
.Ss Runtime Configuration
The following
.Xr sysctl 8
variables are available for tuning:
.Bl -tag -width ".Va net.inet.tcp.cc.htcp.adaptive_backoff" -offset indent
.It Va net.inet.tcp.cc.htcp.adaptive_backoff
Controls use of the adaptive backoff algorithm, which is designed to keep
network queues non-empty during periods of recovery from congestion.
Default is 0 (disabled).
.El
.Bl -tag -width ".Va net.inet.tcp.cc.htcp.rtt_scaling" -offset indent
.It Va net.inet.tcp.cc.htcp.rtt_scaling
Controls use of the RTT scaling algorithm, which is designed to make congestion
window increase invariant with respect to RTT during the connection's regular
mode of operation (congestion avoidance).
Default is 0 (disabled).
