 * Prototocols express flow and CPU affinities by implementing two functions:
 *
 * netisr_m2flow_t - When a packet without M_FLOWID is processed by netisr2,
 *                   it may call into the protocol to generate the missing
 *                   flow ID which should be installed in the packet header.
 *                   If a flow ID cannot be generated, or failure occurs,
 *                   NULL should be returned.
 *
 * netisr_flow2cpu_t - Given a flowid, possibly generated by netisr_m2flow,
 *                   and an optional source identifier (possibly a tid, pcb,
 *                   or kernel pointer), select a CPU to execute the packet
 *                   handler on.  If source isn't used, it will be 0/NULL.
 *
 * XXXRW: If we eventually support dynamic reconfiguration, there should be
 * protocol handlers to notify them of CPU configuration changes so that they
 * can rebalance work.
