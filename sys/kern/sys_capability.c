 * FreeBSD kernel capability facility.
 *
 * Each capability is represented as a file descriptor, but unlike
 * traditional file descriptors, capabilities include a fine-grained and
 * constant mask of rights associated with them.
 *
 * Capabilities wrap other actual object file descriptors -- system calls
 * declare the rights they require when looking up file descriptors.
 *
 * When one capability is created from another, rather than nesting, we
 * directly reference the underlying object but with a new mask, rather than
 * referencing the previous capability.  New capabilities will have the same
 * set or a subset of rights of the capability they are derived from.
