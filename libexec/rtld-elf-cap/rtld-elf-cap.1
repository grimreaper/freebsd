.Dt RTLD-ELF-CAP 1
.Sh NAME
.Nm ld-elf-cap.so.1 ,
.Nm rtld-elf-cap
.Nd capability-mode run-time link editor
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
is a version of
.Xr ld-elf.so.1 1
specific to the sandbox environment created using
.Xr libcapability 3 ,
which provides certain extended or modified linker services for that
environment:
.Bl -bullet
.It
Will not attempt to use global file system namespaces that are not available
when running under
.Xr cap_enter 2 .
.It
Expects to be directly executed using
.Xr fexecve 2 ,
with the desired binary to run passed as file descriptor 3.
.It
Recognizes the addition symbol
.Dv cap_main ,
which will be used instead of the normal ELF entry point for a binary when in
sandbox mode.
This makes it easy a single binary to select different behavior when run in
the different environments.
.It
Interprets the
.Dv LD_LIBCACHE
environmental variable set by sandbox start routines, and implements
.Fn ld_libcache_lookup ,
allowing file descriptors for binaries and libraries passed across
.Xr fexecve 2
to be used by
.Xr libcapability 3 ,
as well as applications.
.It
Implements a version of
.Fn ld_insandbox
that returns true, overriding the libc function that returns false.
.El
.Pp
Applications using
.Dv cap_main
will need to export it as a dynamic symbol, perhaps using
.Xr gcc 1 's
.Dv -rdynamic
command line flag.
.Pp
Most capability-mode applications will be started using the APIs defined in
.Xr libcapability 3 ,
which properly set up the run-time environment for
.Nm .

Support for capabilities and capabilities mode was developed as part of the

Project.

is not documented, and may change.
