.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
utility is used for software RAID configurations.
After a RAID's creation, all components are detected and configured
automatically.
All operations like failure detection, stale component detection, rebuild
of stale components, etc.\& are also done automatically.
The
.Nm
utility uses on-disk metadata to store all needed information.
.Pp
The first argument to
.Nm
indicates an action to be performed:
.Bl -tag -width ".Cm deactivate"
.It Cm label
Create a mirror.
The order of components is important, because a component's priority is based on its position
(starting from 0 to 255).
The component with the biggest priority is used by the
.Cm prefer
balance algorithm
and is also used as a master component when resynchronization is needed,
e.g.\& after a power failure when the device was open for writing.
.Pp
Additional options include:
.Bl -tag -width ".Fl b Ar balance"
.It Fl b Ar balance
Specifies balance algorithm to use, one of:
.Bl -tag -width ".Cm round-robin"
.It Cm load
Read from the component with the lowest load.
This is the default balance algorithm.
.It Cm prefer
Read from the component with the biggest priority.
.It Cm round-robin
Use round-robin algorithm when choosing component to read.
.It Cm split
Split read requests, which are bigger than or equal to slice size on N pieces,
where N is the number of active components.
.El
.It Fl F
Do not synchronize after a power failure or system crash.
Assumes device is in consistent state.
.It Fl h
Hardcode providers' names in metadata.
.It Fl n
Turn off autosynchronization of stale components.
.It Fl s Ar slice
When using the
.Cm split
balance algorithm and an I/O READ request is bigger than or equal to this value,
the I/O request will be split into N pieces, where N is the number of active
components.
Defaults to 4096 bytes.
.El
.It Cm clear
Clear metadata on the given providers.
.It Cm configure
Configure the given device.
.Pp
Additional options include:
.Bl -tag -width ".Fl p Ar priority"
.It Fl a
Turn on autosynchronization of stale components.
.It Fl b Ar balance
Specifies balance algorithm to use.
.It Fl d
Do not hardcode providers' names in metadata.
.It Fl f
Synchronize device after a power failure or system crash.
.It Fl F
Do not synchronize after a power failure or system crash.
Assumes device is in consistent state.
.It Fl h
Hardcode providers' names in metadata.
.It Fl n
Turn off autosynchronization of stale components.
.It Fl p Ar priority
Specifies priority for the given component
.Ar prov .
.It Fl s Ar slice
Specifies slice size for
.Cm split
balance algorithm.
.El
.It Cm rebuild
Rebuild the given mirror components forcibly.
If autosynchronization was not turned off for the given device, this command
should be unnecessary.
.It Cm insert
Add the given component(s) to the existing mirror.
.Pp
Additional options include:
.Bl -tag -width ".Fl p Ar priority"
.It Fl h
Hardcode providers' names in metadata.
.It Fl i
Mark component(s) as inactive immediately after insertion.
.It Fl p Ar priority
Specifies priority of the given component(s).
.El
.It Cm remove
Remove the given component(s) from the mirror and clear metadata on it.
.It Cm activate
Activate the given component(s), which were marked as inactive before.
.It Cm deactivate
Mark the given component(s) as inactive, so it will not be automatically
connected to the mirror.
.It Cm forget
Forget about components which are not connected.
This command is useful when a disk has failed and cannot be reconnected, preventing the
.Cm remove
command from being used to remove it.
.It Cm stop
Stop the given mirror.
.Pp
Additional options include:
.Bl -tag -width ".Fl f"
.It Fl f
Stop the given mirror even if it is opened.
.El
.It Cm dump
Dump metadata stored on the given providers.
.It Cm list

.Pp
Additional options include:

.It Fl v
Be more verbose.
.El
.Sh EXIT STATUS
Exit status is 0 on success, and 1 if the command fails.
