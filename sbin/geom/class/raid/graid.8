.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
utility is used to manage software RAID configurations, supported by GEOM RAID
class.
GEOM RAID class uses on-disk metadata to provide access to software-RAID
volumes defined by different RAID BIOSes.
Depending on RAID BIOS type and it's metadata format, different subsets of
configurations and features supported.
To allow booting from RAID volume metadata format should match RAID BIOS type
and it's capabilities.
To guarantee this match it is recommended to create volumes via RAID BIOS
interface, while experienced users are free to do it using this utility.
.Pp
The first argument to
.Nm
indicates an action to be performed:
.Bl -tag -width ".Cm destroy"
.It Cm label
Create an array with single volume.
.Ar format
argument specifies on-disk metadata format to use for this array,
such as "Intel".
.Ar label
argument specifies label of the created volume.
.Ar level
argument specifies RAID level of the created volume, such as:
"RAID0", "RAID1", etc.
Subsequent list enumerates providers to use as array components.
Special name "NONE" can be used to reserve space for absent disk.
The order of components can be important, depending on specific RAID level
and metadata format.
.Pp
Additional options include:
.Bl -tag -width ".Fl s Ar strip"
.It Fl S Ar size
Use
.Ar size
bytes on each component for this volume.
Should be used if several volumes per array are planned, or if smaller
components going to be inserted later.
Defaults to size of the smallest component.
.It Fl s Ar strip
Specifies strip size in bytes.
Defaults to 131072.
.El
.It Cm add
Create another volume on the existing array.
.Ar name
argument is the name of existing array, reported by label command.
The rest of arguments are the same as for label command.
.It Cm delete
Delete volume(s) from the existing array. When last volume deleted, array is
also getting deleted and metadata erased.
.Ar name
argument is the name of existing array.
Optional
.Ar label
or
.Ar num
arguments allow to specify volume for deletion.
.It Cm insert
Insert specified provider(s) into specified array instead of the first missing
or failed components.
If there is no such components - mark disk(s) as spare.
.It Cm remove
Remove specified provider(s) from specified array and erase metadata.
If there are spare disks present - removed disk will be replaced with one
of them.
.It Cm fail
Mark the given disks(s) as failed, removing from active use unless absolutely
necessary due to exhausted redundancy.
If there are spare disks present - failed disk(s) will be replaced with one
of them.
.It Cm stop
Stop the given array. Metadata not erased.
.Pp
Additional options include:
.Bl -tag -width ".Fl f"
.It Fl f
Stop the given array even if some of it's volumes are opened.
.El
.It Cm list

.Xr geom 8 .

.Sh SUPPORTED METADATA FORMATS
GEOM RAID class implements modular design, allowing different metadata formats
to be used. Support for such formats is implemented now:
.Bl -tag -width "Intel"
.It Intel
Format supported by Intel RAID BIOS. Supports up to two volumes per array.
Supports such configurations: RAID0 (2+ disks), RAID1 (2 disks),
RAID5 (3+ disks), RAID10 (2 or 4 disks).
.El
.Sh SUPPORTED RAID LEVELS
GEOM RAID class implements modular design, allowing different RAID levels
to be used. Support for such formats is implemented now: RAID0, RAID1.
.Sh EXIT STATUS
Exit status is 0 on success, and others if the command fails.
